-- Restructure the goal system into a 4-layer hierarchy:
--   1. constitution_domains — 5 stable, crisis-rooted "north star"
--      principles (Mind / Body / Family / Wealth / Social). NOT SMART.
--      Change only via constitution_amendments with 14-day cooldown +
--      mandatory crisis_justification.
--   2. goals — SMART, outcome-measured, ~1yr commitment, max 3 active per
--      constitution_domain. Reviewed at most quarterly. Change via
--      goal_amendments with 72h cooldown.
--   3. undertakings (existing, repointed) — monthly/quarterly cycles,
--      output-measured, weekly progress review. FK now references the
--      NEW goals table, not constitution_domains.
--   4. task_ref (existing, untouched) — daily/weekly review.
--
-- Migration 015 introduced `goals`/`goal_amendments` with SMART fields
-- baked in at the top layer. That conflated direction (constitution)
-- with measurement (goals). This split separates them.
--
-- Greenfield: live DB has 0 rows in goals, goal_amendments, undertakings,
-- and undertaking_cycles, so the rename path is purely structural.

-- ── 1. Rename old goals → constitution_domains ────────────────────────
-- Drop SMART columns (constitution is direction, not measurement).
-- Add `label` for the named domain (Mind, Body, …).

-- merged_into_id self-FK auto-follows the rename; the constraint name is
-- the only thing that still says "goals". Leave it — PG-generated names
-- aren't user-visible.

-- ── 2. Rename goal_amendments → constitution_amendments ───────────────
-- 14-day cooldown (vs 72h before).
-- crisis_justification required for EVERY kind (not just 'new').
